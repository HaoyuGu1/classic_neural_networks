# classic_neural_networks
classic neural networks to compare with SVNN 

###v1: basic cnn2

###v2: run training on different simulated data, the test MSE and test R-squared values indicated overfitting, with the MSE being too high and the R-squared being too low.

###v3: adding different CNN models
####    model_one_fc.py: one fully connected layer  
####    model_fewer_fc.py: fewer nuerons in fully connected layers
####    model_GAP.py: use Global Average Pooling

###v4: put different CNN models in one file model.py; train.ipynb runs 15 training sessions on 5 models using differnt parameters
