# classic\_neural\_networks

classic neural networks to compare with SVNN

### v1: basic cnn2

### v2: run training on different simulated data, the test MSE and test R-squared values indicated overfitting, with the MSE being too high and the R-squared being too low.

### v3: adding different CNN models

#### model\_one\_fc.py: one fully connected layer

#### model\_fewer\_fc.py: fewer nuerons in fully connected layers

#### model\_GAP.py: use Global Average Pooling

### v4: put different CNN models in one file model.py; train.ipynb runs 15 training sessions on 5 models using differnt parameters

### v5: Add DNN

### v5: Run CNN (20250901 files) and DNN (20250904 files)
